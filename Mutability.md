# Mutable Object

# Immutable Object

# Call by value

##### the immutability of tuples really refers to the physical contents of the tuple data structure (ie. the references it holds), and does not extend to the referenced objects.

# Call by reference

##### each formal parameter of the function gets a copy of each reference in the arguments. In other words, the parameters inside the function become aliases of the actual arguments
